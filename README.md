## Design 

### Colour scheme
The site's background colour is white. This adds to the minimalist aesthetic and also enhances the main imagery. A white background enables the images to stand out more so that they remain the focus of the site. 
The font remains black throughout the site. This is to add to the minimalist aestheict and also helps to focus the visitor's attention on the pictures.  
### Typography 
The Helvetica Neue font is the main font used throughout the site. Helvetica Neue is a clean font and adds to the minimal aesthetic of the site. It is also an appropriate font for image labels. 
### Imagery
The images are the main focus of the webiste. The horizontal display mimics a gallery so visitors can scroll through the individual artworks. Vertical scrolling is introduced on smaller devices, making the site responsive to mobile viewing. 

## Wireframes

- wireframe - page display
- wireframe2 - page dsplay with mobile view
- wireframe3 - page display with social links, about heading text and hompage 

Wireframes are found in the documentation folder of the project in github. 

## Features
Horizontal scrolling of images to represent gallery view.
Collapsable buttons included in the navigation section to help hide text overload. This again allows for the main focus to be on the images displayed.
